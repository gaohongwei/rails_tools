rvmrc
There are three different kinds of rvmrc files:
System wide configuration: /etc/rvmrc
User wide configuration: ~/.rvmrc
Project wide configuration:  .rvmrc

The most interesting one is the project .rvmrc. 
Every time you cd, RVM looks for a file called .rvmrc. 
If it finds it, it executes it.
